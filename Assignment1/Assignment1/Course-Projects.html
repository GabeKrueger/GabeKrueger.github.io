            <h2> Calculator (CSI-2300 Object-Oriented Computing)</h2>
            I used Java to create basic working calculator with a GUI. Had simple computations such as the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Along with a few others, the Gui was very simple, just number buttons and the required computations, in order to solve the problems.
