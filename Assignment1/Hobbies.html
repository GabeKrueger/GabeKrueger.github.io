        <h1>Hobbies:</h1>
        Some of my hobbies are, making/painting minitures, biking, card games, as well as traveling.
        
        <h2>Miniture painting</h2>
        I've been painting minitures for almost a year, learning a lot of tricks from the internet, as well as expanding my painting equipment. Once I finish painting whatever miniture at the time is, it will later be used in the tabletop games.
